# Sudoku

Solving sudokus is fun and a good practice for your brain. Its good implement
with software, too.

This repository is personal experimentation. I plan to implement various
strategies and try to get crazy with the stuff C++ is able to do.

I will measure the speed of solving. I try to max this out!

## Contributing

You can but it really is a personal project where I want to try out stuff and
learn more internals. Its not about reaching a goal but going the way.
